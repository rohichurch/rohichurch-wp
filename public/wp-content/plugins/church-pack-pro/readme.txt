== Description ==

Developed to meet the common needs of churches using WordPress: nicely display listings of staff, create listings of ministries or groups, create widgets without knowing HTML, add photo galleries with ease, and (PRO version only) easily manage events (one time and recurring), .

= People =
This can be used to add a listing of staff, teachers, deacons, elders, or even all members. People can be put into categories and then can be added to the frontend of your site with a simple shortcode to display all people or just a specific category. 

= Groups =
Groups are designed to add a listing of ministries, small groups, classes, etc. Groups can be put into categories and added to the frontend of your site like People.

= Photo Albums =
Easily add albums to your church website. Photos are added using WordPress' core features & displayed nicely on your site.

= Widget Content =
This allows you to create content in the regular WordPress editor and then add it by a widget to your site. No more formatting with HTML required!

= Events =
You can easily add one-time, full day, multi-day, and recurring events. There are no complex options or kitchen sink type features that clutter most event plugins. The frontend display is clean and responsive. The main calendar is added with a shortcode and no extra template files are required. 

= Shortcodes =
Integrated into the visual editor! Easily add toggles, accordions, buttons, colored boxes, tabs, etc.
